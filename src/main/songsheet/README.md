# songsheet package
The goal of this package is to create pdf/html songsheet base on text format. It will either implement chordpro format or something similar.

Basic function to implement:

What [Em]child is [G]this, who, [D]laid to rest
On [Em]Mary's [Am]lap, is [B]sleeping?
Whom [Em]angels [G]greet with [D]anthems sweet,
While [Em]shepherds [B]watch are [Esus]keep[Em]ing?

        Em          G           D 
What 	child is 	this, who, 	laid to rest

    Em      Am 	        B

        Em 	        B 	        Esus 	Em 
While 	shepherds 	watch are 	keep	ing?
